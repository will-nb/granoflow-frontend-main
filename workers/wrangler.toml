# Cloudflare Worker Configuration
# 
# To deploy this worker:
# 1. Install wrangler: npm install -g wrangler
# 2. Login: wrangler login
# 3. Deploy: wrangler deploy
#
# Or use Cloudflare Dashboard to create a new Worker and paste the code from geo-country.js

name = "granoflow-geo-country"
main = "geo-country.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Route configuration
# Uncomment and configure the route where you want this worker to be accessible
# For example, if your domain is example.com, you can set:
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "example.com/geo", zone_name = "example.com" },
#   { pattern = "example.com/api/geo-country", zone_name = "example.com" }
# ]

# Or use a custom domain/route
# You can also set this up in the Cloudflare Dashboard under Workers & Pages
